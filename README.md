Prerequisite:
- The script must be put in a folder.
- Use crontab.
- Use jq

The script will check for new ransomware and put it in an RSS feed.

You just have to add this link: http://127.0.0.1:8555/monitoring.xml in an RSS feed aggregator.

The server is up for 600 seconds. You can modify it according to your needs.

I advise you to activate the script every 4 or 6 hours.
